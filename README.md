# TODO Kotlin/Native ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem.svg?branch=master)
This TODO project is an easy and customizable tool which will help you organize your time. Application runs fully in terminal and was built with Linux in mind.

## Key binding
For now you can't change key binding, so you need to use following binds:
* <kbd>Q</kbd> - exits program
* <kbd>INSERT</kbd> - Creates new header / checkbox
* <kbd>DELETE</kbd> / <kbd>R</kbd> - Deletes header / checkbox. In edit mode deletes last letter
* <kbd>TAB</kbd> / <kbd>ENTER</kbd> - Expands header
* <kbd>ENTER</kbd> - Change state of checkbox. It saves text in edit mode
* <kbd>E</kbd> - Enter edit mode of line you are pointing on
